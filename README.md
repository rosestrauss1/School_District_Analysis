  ## Results

* How is the district summary affected?

In the district summary without the 9th grade math and reading scores, the average reading score was 81.9 and the average math score was 78.9. The percent passing math was 74.8% and the percent passing reading was 85.7%. In the district summary including these scores, the reading score average was 81.9 and the average math score was 79. The percent passing math was 75% and the percent passing reading was 86%. This shows that these scores did have a small impact on the district analysis, and had a larger impact on the math score than the reading score. 

* How is the school summary affected?

In the school summary without the 9th grade math and reading scores where the reading and math scores are replaced with the data just from 10th-12th graders, the average reading score was 83.9 and the average math score was 83.3. The percent passing math was 93% and the percent passing reading was 97%. The overall passing percentage was 90.6%. In the school summary including these scores, the reading score average was 83.8 and the average math score was 83.4. The percent passing math was 93% and the percent passing reading was 97%. The overall passing percentage was 90.9%. This shows that when Thomas High School's scores were replaced with the 10th-12th grade scores only, it caused the average reading score to slightly increase, and the average math score to slightly increase. The precent passing slightly decreased. This could mean that the 9th grade scores were inflated so more students passed, but not past a threshold that would have increased the average math and reading scores.
